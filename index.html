                            Buying shoes and clothes for my older kids is expensive and I can’t always get them 
                            new things at the same time. I was fortunate enough to find really nice new men and 
                            women sizes that they liked and that were in the sizes that I needed.

                            Hi, Remember Me? focuses on helping youth participants ages 11-18 who feel forgotten or

                            world and empower them to become who they are meant to be in the future. This is done 
                            through group sessions with like-minded youth who want to work to change the narrative. 
                            We bring guest speakers who share life stories and encourage the youths to be change 
                            agents for the future. We also teach etiquette classes, budgeting and basic financial 
                            literacy, grooming, and cooking classes.
